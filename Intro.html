    An Intro to the Pallas Cat
  </div>
  <div class="content">
   <p><strong>The Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul)</strong>, also known as the <em>manul</em>, is a small wild cat with long and dense light grey fur, and rounded ears set low on the sides of the head. Its head-and-body length ranges from <strong>46 to 65 cm</strong> (18 to 26 in) with a <strong>21 to 31 cm</strong> (8.3 to 12.2 in) long bushy tail. It is well camouflaged and adapted to the cold continental climate in its native range, which receives little rainfall and experiences a wide range of temperatures.</p>

<p>The Pallas's cat was first described in <strong>1776</strong> by Peter Simon Pallas, who observed it in the vicinity of Lake Baikal. Since then, it has been recorded across a large region in Central Asia, albeit in widely spaced sites from the Caucasus, Iranian Plateau, Hindu Kush, parts of the Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau to the Altai-Sayan region and South Siberian Mountains. It inhabits rocky montane grasslands and shrublands, where the snow cover is below <strong>15–20 cm</strong> (6–8 in). It finds shelter in rock crevices and burrows, and preys foremost on lagomorphs and rodents. The female gives birth to between <strong>two and six kittens</strong> in spring.</p>

<p>Due to its widespread range and assumed large population, the Pallas's cat has been listed as <strong>Least Concern</strong> on the <em>IUCN Red List</em> since <strong>2020</strong>. Some population units are threatened by poaching, prey base decline due to rodent control programs, and habitat fragmentation as a result of mining and infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>The Pallas's cat has been kept in zoos since the early <strong>1950s</strong>. As of <strong>2018</strong>, <strong>60 zoos</strong> in Europe, Russia, North America, and Japan participate in Pallas's cat captive breeding programs.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p><em>Felis manul</em> was the scientific name used by Peter Simon Pallas in <strong>1776</strong>, who first described a Pallas's cat that he had encountered near the Dzhida River southeast of Lake Baikal. Several Pallas's cat zoological specimens were subsequently described:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Felis nigripectus</em> proposed by Brian Houghton Hodgson in <strong>1842</strong> was based on three specimens from Tibet.</li>
    <li><em>Otocolobus manul ferrugineus</em> proposed by Sergey Ognev in <strong>1928</strong> was an erythristic specimen from the Kopet Dag mountains.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Otocolobus</em> was proposed by Johann Friedrich von Brandt in <strong>1842</strong> as a generic name. Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic rank of <em>Otocolobus</em> in <strong>1907</strong>, described several Pallas's cat skulls in detail and considered the Pallas's cat an aberrant form of <em>Felis</em>.</p>

<h2>The Pallas cat appearence And Genetics</h2>
    <p><strong>The Pallas's cat's fur</strong> is light grey with pale yellowish-ochre or pale yellowish-reddish hues. Some hair tips are white and some blackish. Its fur is greyer and denser with fewer markings visible in winter than in the summer. The forehead and top of the head are light grey with small black spots. It has two black zigzag lines on the cheeks running from the corner of the eyes to the jaw joints. Its chin, whiskers, lower and upper lips are white. It has narrow black stripes on the back, consisting of five to seven dark transversal lines across the lower back. Its grey tail has seven narrow black rings and a black tip. The underfur is 40 mm (1.6 in) long and 19 μm thick, and the guard hairs up to 69 mm (2.7 in) long and 93 μm thick on the back. Its fur is soft and dense with up to 9,000 hairs/cm<sup>2</sup> (58,000 hairs/in<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p><strong>The Pallas's cat's ears</strong> are grey with a yellowish tinge on the back and a darker rim, but with whitish hair in front and in the ear pinnae. Its rounded ears are set low on the side, such that it can peer over an object and show only a relatively small part of the head above the eyes without depressing the ears. This can give its face a look of ferocity and unrest. Its eyes are encircled by white. The iris is yellowish, and its pupils contract to small circular disks in sunlight. Among the Felinae, it shares this trait of round pupils with Puma, Herpailurus, and Acinonyx species.</p>

<p><strong>The Pallas's cat is about the size</strong> of a domestic cat (<em>Felis catus</em>). Its stocky posture with the long and dense fur makes it appear stout and plush. Its head-to-body is 46 to 65 cm (18 to 26 in) long with a 21 to 31 cm (8.3 to 12.2 in) long tail. It weighs 2.5 to 4.5 kg (5 lb 8 oz to 9 lb 15 oz). Its body is stout, and its skull is rounded with a short nasal bone, an enlarged cranial part, and rounded zygomatic arches. Its orbits are large and directed forward. Its legs are short with short and sharp retractile claws.</p>

<p>The skull of males is 87.2–95.1 mm (3.43–3.74 in) long and 66–74 mm (2.6–2.9 in) wide at the base. Females have a 84.1–96.3 mm (3.31–3.79 in) long and 64.7–68.1 mm (2.55–2.68 in) wide skull. The lower carnassial teeth are powerful, and the upper carnassials are short and massive. The first pair of upper premolars is absent. The dental formula is 3.1.2.13.1.2.1 × 2 = 28. It has a bite force at the canine tip of 155.4 newtons and a bite force quotient at the canine tip of 113.8.</p>

<p>The mitochondrial genome of the Pallas's cat consists of 16,672 base pairs containing 13 protein-coding, 22 transfer RNA and two ribosomal RNA genes and one non-coding RNA control region.</p>

    
    <h1>Pallas's Cat Reproduction</h1>

    <h2>Female Maturity and Estrus</h2>
    <p>The female Pallas's cat becomes sexually mature at around one year of age. She experiences estrus for a duration of 26 to 42 hours.</p>

    <h2>Gestation and Breeding Behavior</h2>
    <p>The gestation period for Pallas's cats lasts between 66 to 75 days. A male Pallas's cat housed in captivity, under natural lighting conditions, displayed heightened aggressive and territorial behavior during the breeding season, which spans from September to December. During this season, the male's blood testosterone levels were three times higher compared to the non-breeding season. Additionally, its ejaculate contained more concentrated sperm with improved motility.</p>

    <h2>Birth and Early Life</h2>
    <p>In the wild, female Pallas's cats give birth to litters comprising two to six kittens between late April and the end of May. Newborn kittens have fuzzy fur and their eyes remain closed for approximately two weeks. A male kitten born in a zoo weighed 89 g (3.1 oz), measured 12.3 cm (4.8 in) in length, and had a tail that was 5.5 cm (2.2 in) long.</p>

    <p>In central Mongolia, observations revealed that seven females with kittens used 20 different dens for periods ranging from 4 to 60 days. These maternal dens were located either among rocks or in former burrows of the Tarbagan marmot (Marmota sibirica), and they typically had at least two entrances. In another instance, a Pallas's cat in Iran was observed using aged Greek juniper (Juniperus excelsa) cavities as breeding dens for a litter of four kittens.</p>

    <h2>Kitten Development</h2>
    <p>Kittens that are two months old weigh between 500 to 600 g (17.6 to 21.2 oz), and their fur progressively grows longer. These kittens initiate hunting activities around the age of five months and attain adult size by six to seven months of age.</p>
