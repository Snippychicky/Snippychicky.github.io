    An Intro to the Pallas Cat
  </div>
  <div class="content">
   <p><strong>The Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul)</strong>, also known as the <em>manul</em>, is a small wild cat with long and dense light grey fur, and rounded ears set low on the sides of the head. Its head-and-body length ranges from <strong>46 to 65 cm</strong> (18 to 26 in) with a <strong>21 to 31 cm</strong> (8.3 to 12.2 in) long bushy tail. It is well camouflaged and adapted to the cold continental climate in its native range, which receives little rainfall and experiences a wide range of temperatures.</p>

<p>The Pallas's cat was first described in <strong>1776</strong> by Peter Simon Pallas, who observed it in the vicinity of Lake Baikal. Since then, it has been recorded across a large region in Central Asia, albeit in widely spaced sites from the Caucasus, Iranian Plateau, Hindu Kush, parts of the Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau to the Altai-Sayan region and South Siberian Mountains. It inhabits rocky montane grasslands and shrublands, where the snow cover is below <strong>15–20 cm</strong> (6–8 in). It finds shelter in rock crevices and burrows, and preys foremost on lagomorphs and rodents. The female gives birth to between <strong>two and six kittens</strong> in spring.</p>

<p>Due to its widespread range and assumed large population, the Pallas's cat has been listed as <strong>Least Concern</strong> on the <em>IUCN Red List</em> since <strong>2020</strong>. Some population units are threatened by poaching, prey base decline due to rodent control programs, and habitat fragmentation as a result of mining and infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>The Pallas's cat has been kept in zoos since the early <strong>1950s</strong>. As of <strong>2018</strong>, <strong>60 zoos</strong> in Europe, Russia, North America, and Japan participate in Pallas's cat captive breeding programs.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p><em>Felis manul</em> was the scientific name used by Peter Simon Pallas in <strong>1776</strong>, who first described a Pallas's cat that he had encountered near the Dzhida River southeast of Lake Baikal. Several Pallas's cat zoological specimens were subsequently described:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Felis nigripectus</em> proposed by Brian Houghton Hodgson in <strong>1842</strong> was based on three specimens from Tibet.</li>
    <li><em>Otocolobus manul ferrugineus</em> proposed by Sergey Ognev in <strong>1928</strong> was an erythristic specimen from the Kopet Dag mountains.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Otocolobus</em> was proposed by Johann Friedrich von Brandt in <strong>1842</strong> as a generic name. Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic rank of <em>Otocolobus</em> in <strong>1907</strong>, described several Pallas's cat skulls in detail and considered the Pallas's cat an aberrant form of <em>Felis</em>.</p>
